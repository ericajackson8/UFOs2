# UFO Analysis
## Analysis Overview
Dana has an opportunity to do some research about her hometown.  She decides to focus on the topic of UFO sightings since that has interested her since childhood. Dana would like to build a website that will house her article and all of the data that she has come across regarding UFO sightings. This is where our expertise is needed to help build the webpage t display the article and data; and provide a way for users to filter the sighting data since it is so vast.
## Analysis Results
Users may view and search the UFO sighting data by using the Filter Search section in the left of the page.
## Summary and Conclusions
Although this website gives users flexibility in searching on one of five criteria, or all criteria simultaneously; one drawback might be how the criteria values are entered.  The user must enter the filter criteria exactly as it appears in the data.  If someone accidently puts in capital letters, they would not find a match. 
### Recommendations 

1. Remove case sensitivity when filtering the criteria.
2. Provide some way for users to know the range of possible values for each search criteria. This could be done via some help text or information pop-up.
